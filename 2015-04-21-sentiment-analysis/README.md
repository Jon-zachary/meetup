This script, presented at the April 2015 Meetup, provides three examples of sentiment analysis using the **syuzhet** package. The first example examines the narrative structure of Moby Dick. The second compares the sentiment of tweets with #Obama from March and April 2015, respectively. The final example analyzes survey data.

The script assumes no prior knowledge of sentiment analysis or the syuzhet package, but does use functions from the dplyr, tidyr and ggplot2 packages.

After this demonstration, hopefully Meetup participants will have an understanding of how to begin and carry out a basic sentiment analysis in R.
